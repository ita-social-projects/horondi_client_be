<p>For several years in a row, straw bags have remained at the top. They are suitable for resort and city walks. They can also be worn under a classic suit or an elegant dress. Designer Solomiya Nebozhuk says that straw bags will make your image relax and add a touch of Parisian style. You can combine them with jeans, a white shirt and loafers. A straw shopper bag will go well with white culottes and a silk shirt. This bag is the basis of the 2020 summer wardrobe, a kind of springboard for fashion experiments. Designers improve the model of a classic straw bag every year. The main trend positions among straw bags were: shopper bag, minodiere, crossbody bag, top handle.</p>
<h3>Bulky and soft clutch</h3>

<p>In the spring-summer 2020 season, clutches took the absolute lead among trend bags. Soft, unstructured and large clutches are part of the basic wardrobe of all fashionistas. The founder and king of this trend was the Italian brand Bottega Veneta, which presented the cult clutch Pouch. Since then, other brands have begun to actively offer such bags in their collections. Stylist Solomiya Nebozhuk explains that a clutch will become a universal element of your wardrobe. It can be combined with casual images, evening or cocktail dresses. It is important to remember that it should not be combined with very relaxed things, as your image may become too homely. It is better to prefer structured jeans, jackets or shirts. Also, the strong relaxation of the image can be compensated by hats and shoes.</p>
<h3>Bags with massive chains</h3>

<p>Chains everywhere are the main credo of summer 2020 trends. Designers add massive chains to all models of bags. They perform the function of decoration rather than a full-fledged handle in the accessory. Such bags can be combined with casual images, in which case the accessory will be an accent. It can also be combined with elegant skirts and blouses. Then a bag with a chain will reduce the degree of romance in the image.</p>
<h3>Microbags</h3>

<p>As last year, in 2020 microbags take their place among the trends. The founder of the idea of ​​their use was the fashion house Jacquemus, which released its most famous microbag. It is so small that only a few coins can be placed in it. Now mini-bags have almost lost their function and have become more of an accessory. Most often they are made with long chains. According to stylist Solomiya Nebozhuk, such purse bags are combined with other bags. Sometimes fashionistas use them as a necklace. Surprisingly, this trend is perfectly combined with every style. The microbag can become a part of a casual, boho, evening or minimalist image. In addition, it will breathe a little freshness and trendiness into a regular base bow.</p>
<h3>Quilted crossbody bags (over the shoulder)</h3>

<p>This type of bag is considered the most versatile. The ideologue of this trend was also the Italian brand Bottega Veneta. Their shoulder bag Cassette has become very popular among fashion connoisseurs. This model was picked up by mass markets, so today a similar model can be found on the shelves of budget stores. The crossbad bag can be beautifully styled with floral dresses, jeans and classic T-shirts (possibly polo) or with lingerie-style suits. This type of trendy bags can fully claim a place in the basic wardrobe. The designer recommends choosing this accessory in a neutral color and style, because then it will suit many clothing combinations.</p>
<h3>Art bags</h3>

<p>If you want to add a bright accent to your everyday bow, art bags will help. Bags with animal prints, unusual minodieri, bags with feathers, beads, knitted accessories, denim bags - this is not the whole list of fantasy of designers in 2020. They can combine different colors, have additional applications or unusual shapes and materials. It is better to wear them with minimalist and calm clothes or to emphasize shoes or hats. You can also experiment with earrings, chains or bracelets that will resonate with the prints on the bag.</p>
<h3>Baguette bag</h3>

<p>This bag model became famous in the 2000s thanks to the main character of the series "Sex in the Big City" Carrie Bradshaw. It was she who adored and collected models of Fendi Baguette bags. Now in the collections of almost every fashion house you can find their interpretations of the iconic baguette bag. Designers experiment with all its details, so it can become the focus of the basic wardrobe. Also, the baguette bag is a great addition to any image, as it adds a touch of vintage.</p>
